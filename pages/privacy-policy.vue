      <h2>What personal data do we collect about you?</h2>

      <section>
        <p>
          When we say personal data, or personal information, we mean any information about you from which you can be
          identified. We do not mean data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
        </p>
        <p>
          We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped
          together as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Identity Data</b> includes first name, last name (including maiden name or married name as you provide
            it), username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth and gender.

          </li>
          <li>

          We also collect, use and share <b>Aggregated Data</b> such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.
          Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this
          data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to
          calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect
          Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the
          combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not collect any <b>Special Categories of Personal Data</b> about you (this includes details about your
          race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade
          union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any

          into with you (for example, to provide you with services). In this case, we may have to cancel a service you
          have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

          We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and
              fundamental rights do not override those interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our legitimate interests are those of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to

              any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal
              data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are
              overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by

          We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and
          advertising. You can update your marketing preferences via your profile page or by contacting us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Transaction, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we
          think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services
          and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).1
        </p>
        <p>
          You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us by using our
          services and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

      <p>
        We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost,
        used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal
        data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will

    <section id="privacy-policy-duration">
      <h2>How long do we keep personal data for?</h2>
      <p>
        We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected
        it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting
        requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we
        reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity
        of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the
        purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
        and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy
        which you can request from us by contacting us.

      <p>
        In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see
        <a href="#privacy-policy-your-rights">your legal rights</a>, below for further information.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for
        research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice
        to you.

      <h2>Your legal rights</h2>
      <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.</p>
      <p>You may have the following rights:-</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <b>Request access</b> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables
          you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Request correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete
          or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
          provide to us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data
          where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
          remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
          below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
          personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
          request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of
          your request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
          third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
          processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the
          right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we
          may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
          rights and freedoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Request restriction of processing</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
            processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li>
            <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
            <li>
              Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
              or defend legal claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
              grounds to use it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Request the transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a
          third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note
          that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or
          where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will
          not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your
          consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the
          time you withdraw your consent.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our

        <h3>No fee usually required</h3>
        <p>
          You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However,
          we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively,
          we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What we may need from you</h3>
        <p>
          We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
          access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that
          personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask
          you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
        <p>
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a
          month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
          notify you and keep you updated.
